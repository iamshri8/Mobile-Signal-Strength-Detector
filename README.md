# Mobile-Signal-Strength-Detector


The goal of the project is to find out the best mobile network service provider in the city of Kiel, Germany. This is an application for measuring the signal strength of different mobile network service providers at different locations. 

The project has two parts, one for recording the signal strength from the mobile (an android application for recording the signal strength), another part(web application) for fetching the results of the signal strength from the android application and do analysis of the data collected. The web application also contains different charts for visualizing the data.
